## Description

This module downloads the WP-CLI tool and then uses it to download and configure WordPress instances.

This module does not manage a multisite installation but it can create one or several WordPress instances on same puppet node.
Each instance, on the same node, has dedicated settings and can be managed separately.

## Setup

### What wordpress affects

As the name of module can explain, it affects WordPress installation and configuration.

This modules does not manage :
 * system account, owner of WordPress files.
 * nginx or apache vhost
 * mariadb or mysql database and user
 * php install

They have to be created before for instance by `puppetlabs-mysql`, `puppetlabs-apache` and `puppetlabs-account`.

### Setup Requirements

This `wordpress` module depends on `puppetlabs-stdlib` and `puppet-archive`

### Beginning with wordpress

The following very basic step will install WP-CLI tool :

```
class { 'wordpress' :
}
```

## Usage

### Typical installation

The following code :
  * downloads and installs WP-CLI.
  * downloads and installs core WordPress in the last available version.
  * creates tables in an already existing database `wp_mywpname`.
  * configures core WordPress
  * sets the title of the instance.
  * WP-CLI is ran as `wp` user. Files are owned by already existing user `wp`. 

```
class { 'wordpress' :
  settings => {
    'mywpname.mydomaine.com' => {
      wproot        => '/var/www/mywpname',
      owner         => 'wp',
      dbhost        => 'YY.YY.YY.YY',
      dbname        => 'wp_mywpname',
      dbuser        => 'mywp_dbusername',
      dbpasswd      => 'secretpass',
      wpadminuser   => 'mywp_adminuser',
      wpadminpasswd => 'othersecret',
      wpadminemail  => 'foo@mydomain.com',
      wptitle       => 'the title is to deploy WordPress with puppet',
    }
  }
}
```

### Typical installation + self update by WordPress

The following code :
  * downloads and installs WP-CLI.
  * downloads and installs core WordPress in the last available version.
  * creates tables in an already existing database `wp_mywpname`.
  * configures core WordPress
  * sets the title of the instance.
  * WP-CLI is ran as `wp` user. Files are owned by already existing user `wp`. 
  * enables WordPress internal self update process (disabled by default).

```
class { 'wordpress' :
  settings => {
    'mywpname.mydomaine.com' => {
      wproot        => '/var/www/mywpname',
      owner         => 'wp',
      dbhost        => 'YY.YY.YY.YY',
      dbname        => 'wp_mywpname',
      dbuser        => 'mywp_dbusername',
      dbpasswd      => 'secretpass',
      wpadminuser   => 'mywp_adminuser',
      wpadminpasswd => 'othersecret',
      wpadminemail  => 'foo@mydomain.com',
      wptitle       => 'the title is to deploy WordPress with puppet',
      wpselfupdate  => 'enabled',
    }
  }
}
```

### Typical installation + update by Puppet

The following code :
  * downloads and installs WP-CLI.
  * downloads and installs core WordPress in the last available version.
  * creates tables in an already existing database `wp_mywpname`.
  * configures core WordPress
  * sets the title of the instance.
  * WP-CLI is ran as `wp` user. Files are owned by already existing user `wp`. 
  * disables WordPress internal self update process.
  * configures puppet to make WordPress core and language update to latest available version.

If an update occured (checked one time each day), you will 
find in `/var/wordpress_archives` :
 * dump of database that was there before the update.
 * archive of files that were there before the update.

```
class { 'wordpress' :
  settings => {
    'mywpname.mydomaine.com' => {
      ensure        => 'latest',
      wproot        => '/var/www/mywpname',
      owner         => 'wp',
      dbhost        => 'YY.YY.YY.YY',
      dbname        => 'wp_mywpname',
      dbuser        => 'mywp_dbusername',
      dbpasswd      => 'secretpass',
      wpadminuser   => 'mywp_adminuser',
      wpadminpasswd => 'othersecret',
      wpadminemail  => 'foo@mydomain.com',
      wptitle       => 'the title is to deploy WordPress with puppet',
    }
  }
}
```

### Typical installation + add themes + add plugins + locale

The following code :
  * downloads and installs WP-CLI.
  * downloads and installs core WordPress in the last available version and in french.
  * creates tables in an already existing database `wp_mywpname`.
  * configures core WordPress
  * sets the title of the instance.
  * WP-CLI is ran as `wp` user. Files are owned by already existing user `wp`. 
  * manages more than defaults themes and plugins provided with core.

```
class { 'wordpress' :
  settings => {
    'mywpname.mydomaine.com' => {
      wproot        => '/var/www/mywpname',
      owner         => 'wp',
      locale        => 'fr_FR',
      dbhost        => 'YY.YY.YY.YY',
      dbname        => 'wp_mywpname',
      dbuser        => 'mywp_dbusername',
      dbpasswd      => 'secretpass',
      wpadminuser   => 'mywp_adminuser',
      wpadminpasswd => 'othersecret',
      wpadminemail  => 'foo@mydomain.com',
      wptitle       => 'the title is to deploy WordPress with puppet',
      wpresources   => {
        plugin => [
          { name => 'plugin1', 'ensure' => 'present' },
          { name => 'plugin2', 'ensure' => 'absent' },
        ],
        theme => [
          { name => 'themenew', 'ensure' => 'latest' },
          { name => 'themeold', 'ensure' => 'absent' },
        ]
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Several installations

The following code makes two installations on same Puppet node with dedicated settings :
  * only WordPress in `wp2.foo.org` in updated by Puppet, the other is not updated at all.
  * the two WordPress instances use the same database server.
  * the list of used plugins and themes configure are differents in each intance.

```
class { 'wordpress': 
  settings => {
    'wp2.foo.org' => {
      ensure        => 'latest',
      owner         => 'wp2',
      locale        => 'fr_FR',
      dbhost        => 'XX.XX.XX.XX',
      dbname        => 'wordpress2',
      dbuser        => 'wp2userdb',
      dbpasswd      => 'secret_a',
      wproot        => '/var/www/wp2.foo.org',
      wptitle       => 'hola this wp2 instance is installed by puppet',
      wpadminuser   => 'wpadmin',
      wpadminpasswd => 'secret_b',
      wpadminemail  => 'bar@foo.org',
      wpresources   => {
        plugin => [
          { name => 'plugin_a', 'ensure' => 'latest' },
          { name => 'plugin_b', 'ensure' => 'absent' },
        ],
        theme => [
          { name => 'themenew_a', },
          { name => 'themeold_a', 'ensure' => 'absent' },
        ]
      },
    },
    'wp3.foo.org' => {
      owner         => 'wp3',
      dbhost        => 'XX.XX.XX.XX',
      dbname        => 'wordpress3',
      dbuser        => 'wp3userdb',
      dbpasswd      => 'secret_c',
      wproot        => '/var/www/wp3.foo.org',
      wptitle       => 'hola this wp3 instance is installed by puppet',
      wpadminuser   => 'wpadmin',
      wpadminpasswd => 'secret_d',
      wpadminemail  => 'bar@foo.org',
      wpresources   => {
        plugin => [
          { name => 'plugin_a', },
          { name => 'plugin_b', },
          { name => 'plugin_c', },
          { name => 'plugin_d', 'ensure' => 'absent' },
        ],
        theme => [
          { name => 'themenew_b', },
          { name => 'themeold_a', 'ensure' => 'absent' },
        ]
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Reference

Details in `REFERENCE.md`.

## Limitations

This module is tested with following OSes :
  * Ubuntu 16.04
  * Debian 8, 9

Known bugs are listed in `CHANGELOG.md` file.

Even if module should work with Puppet4, Puppet 4 is end of life since 2019-01-01.
So tests with Puppet 4 are removed.
Acceptance tests are done with last available release of Puppet 5 and Puppet 6 (AIO).

PHP shiped with CentOS 7 is version 5.4. WordPress 5.2 requires at least 5.6.20.
Default values for CentOS7 are not removed from the code.
By this way we expect the module should works if php version requirement is respected.
But, CentOS7 is removed from acceptance tests and from the list of compatible OSes.
